      h4 CREATORS
      p Creators have access to the most powerful analytics and marketing tools available to crowdfunded products. They are able to leverage these tools and the new, more transparent relationship with backers to build a community that has real buy-in to what they are building.
      h4 BACKERS
      p Backers get to continue supporting products they are excited about, but without the fear of big failures down the line. They are also brought into details about the development that they wouldnâ€™t otherwise get, which only serves to build their support and excitement about the product.
